Build your own MacBook Mini with your GPD Pocket 2.

![macOS Mojave 10.15.3 running on the GPD Pocket 2 m3-8100y](images/screenshot.png?raw=true)

What's not working:
- wifi
- internal sound
- emmc

Also currently I get a kernel panic very often, while having MacOS running on my external SSD connected via USB.

But besides that it works great - even the touchscreen works, thanks to the help of some other github users.
